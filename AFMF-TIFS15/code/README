The Matlab codes in this package can be used to process 8-bit grayscale 
median filtered images using the image variational deconvolution framework
for median filtered image quality enhancement and anti-forensics, 
proposed in the following paper:

Wei Fan, Kai Wang, Fran√ßois Cayre, and Zhang Xiong, "Median Filtered Image 
Quality Enhancement and Anti-Forensics via Variational Deconvolution",
submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security.

Please run 'demo.m' to see how the code works to process a median filtered 
image using the proposed method. 

The parameters (opts.nb_omega, opts.nb_lambda, and opts.nb_gamma) are tuned
on MFTE100 dataset. The linear regression coefficients stored in the 
'mfpemf3GGPElrCoefs.dat' file are estimated on MFPE dataset. 
These parameters are chosen for the images in MFTE and MFTR datasets, yet  
not necessarily optimal for other images. Parameter estimation and grid 
search need to be performed if the user processes images from other 
datasets other than these used in the manuscript. Please refer to Sec. IV 
of the manuscript for details. Besides, concerning the quality enhancement  
for median filtered images, very few MFTE images do not achieve a quality 
improvement. However, on average, the quality of the processed median 
filtered images is improved in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics (see Sec. 
IV-C of the manuscript for experimental results). A possible reason here is 
that we use the same parameter setting for all the MFTE images, but this 
setting may not be the best tuned for every image.

The pixel value perturbation opertaion proposed in the paper for median
filtering anti-forensic purposes involves certain randomness and may
therefore result in possible different processed images. Hence, it cannot 
be guaranteed that each running of the program will produce *exactly* the 
same anti-forensic image. However, the difference among the results 
generated by different runnings of the program is very slight.
